# Project 4: Locking

This project is divided into two parts.

Part 1 is due: **Friday, 4/3/2020, 11:59 PM**.

Part 2 is due: **Tuesday, 4/14/2020, 11:59 PM**.

Part 2 requires Part 1 to be completed first. See the Grading section at the
bottom of this document for notes on how your score will be computed.

**You will not be able to use slip minutes for the Part 1 deadline.** The standard late penalty
(33%/day, counted in days not minutes) will apply after the Part 1 deadline. Slip minutes
may be used for the Part 2 deadline, and the late penalty for the two parts are independent.

For example, if you submit Part 1 at 5:30 AM two days after it is due,
and Part 2 at 6:00 PM the day after it is due, you will recieve:
- 66% penalty on your Part 1 submission
- No penalty on your Part 2 submission
- A total of 1080 slip minutes consumed

## Overview

In this project, you will implement multigranularity locking and integrate
it into the codebase.

## Getting Started

This assignment will be released on **Wednesday, 3/18/2020**.
