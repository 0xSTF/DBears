# Project 3: Joins and Query Optimization

This project is divided into two parts.

Part 1 is due: **Sunday, 3/8/2020, 11:59 PM**.

Part 2 is due: **Monday, 3/16/2020, 11:59 PM**.

Part 2 does not require Part 1 to be completed first, but you will need to make sure
any code you write for Part 1 does not throw an exception before starting Part 2. See
the Grading section at the bottom of this document for notes on how your score will
be computed.

**You will not be able to use slip minutes for the Part 1 deadline.** The standard late penalty
(33%/day, counted in days not minutes) will apply after the Part 1 deadline. Slip minutes
may be used for the Part 2 deadline, and the late penalty for the two parts are independent.

For example, if you submit Part 1 at 5:30 AM two days after it is due,
and Part 2 at 6:00 PM the day after it is due, you will recieve:
- 66% penalty on your Part 1 submission
- No penalty on your Part 2 submission
- A total of 1080 slip minutes consumed

## Overview

In this project, you will implement some join algorithms and a limited
version of the Selinger optimizer.

## Getting Started

This assignment will be released on **Friday, 2/28/2020**.
